# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit card fraud is a growing problem, with fraudsters using increasingly sophisticated methods to steal card information and make unauthorized transactions. Machine learning has shown promise for detecting credit card fraud by analyzing transaction data and identifying patterns that are indicative of fraudulent activity.

In this project, we aim to develop a model for credit card fraud detection using machine learning techniques. We will collect a dataset of credit card transactions labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate, and train a machine learning model to recognize patterns in the transaction data. The model will be validated on a separate test set, and its performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

The goal of this project is to provide a reliable and efficient tool for identifying credit card fraud, which could help financial institutions and consumers protect themselves against fraudulent activity.
